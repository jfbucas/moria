 Python Implementation Prompts Created - Python_Implementation_Prompts.txt

Complete Implementation Guide Ready!
I've created 22 detailed prompts organized in 7 phases to reimplement MORIA in Python as faithfully as possible to the original.

📋 Phase Breakdown
PHASE 1: Foundation & Data Structures (3 prompts)

Project setup with exact data structures
Game constants & configuration
Monster & item templates from ENTITY_DATABASE.md
PHASE 2: Display & Input (2 prompts)

Curses-based display (80×25 terminal)
Keyboard input (4-direction movement only)
PHASE 3: Core Game Logic (4 prompts)

Main game loop (exact turn order)
Combat system (precise formulas)
Monster AI (greedy pathfinding + move_toggle)
Magic system (71 effects)
PHASE 4: World & Exploration (3 prompts)

Dungeon generation (Kruskal's MST)
Level persistence (RAM-only, visited flags)
Player movement (stairs damage, traps, etc.)
PHASE 5: Shops, UI & Menus (4 prompts)

Shop system (buy-only)
High scores (binary file, winners first)
Death & game over
Main menu & character creation
PHASE 6: Polish & Testing (4 prompts)

Inventory management
Message system
Save system (high scores only - NO game saves)
Validation tests
PHASE 7: Final Integration (2 prompts)

Complete integration
Package & distribution
🎯 Key Features
Each prompt includes:

✅ Exact formulas from documentation
✅ Code snippets ready to implement
✅ Critical reminders (4-dir movement, move_toggle, etc.)
✅ Cross-references to specific documentation sections
✅ Testing criteria to validate correctness
⚠️ Critical Implementation Requirements
The guide emphasizes 10 must-have features:

4-direction movement ONLY
All monsters move every 2 turns (move_toggle)
Going down stairs damages HP
Food decreases by 1/turn
NO save game feature
Score = total gold
Greedy pathfinding
No field of view
3 stats only
Winners rank above non-winners
📚 Documentation References
Each prompt links to specific sections:

MORIA_COMPLETE.md - Main reference
COMBAT_SYSTEM.md - Combat formulas
MONSTER_AI.md - AI behavior
MAGIC_SYSTEM.md - All 71 effects
PLAYER_ACTIONS.md - Movement & progression
SHOP_AND_UI.md - Shops & high scores
UNNAMED_FUNCTIONS.md - Utility functions
🚀 Getting Started
Recommended approach:

Start with Prompt 1 (data structures)
Follow prompts in order
Test after each phase
Reference documentation constantly
Don't deviate from original behavior
Estimated effort: 40-80 hours for complete implementation

The prompts are designed to be copy-paste ready while ensuring 100% fidelity to the original DOS MORIA 1.9.8.7!
